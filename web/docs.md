In the present computer era, maintaining several accounts with distinct, good passwords for each is imperative in order to have online security. But it's not easy remembering different passwords. That is where a Password Manager helps. It is a type of computer application that helps keep users' passwords safe and handles them on their behalf. Using encryption methods, password managers secure passwords against unauthorized use, allowing users to easily keep strong, different passwords for every account without the danger of forgetting them.

Background:
Password managers have evolved as a crucial solution in response to the growing complexity of online security. With the increasing number of online services requiring user authentication, individuals are often faced with the challenge of creating and remembering multiple strong, unique passwords. Reusing passwords or choosing weak ones can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, including data breaches and identity theft. To combat these issues, password managers were developed as tools that not only store and organize credentials but also generate strong, random passwords for users. Most modern password managers utilize robust encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data, ensuring that even if the device or application is compromised, the stored passwords remain secure. This technology has become an essential part of personal and organizational cybersecurity practices.

Problem Statement:
With more and more services and sites moving online, users need to come up with and keep different passwords for each of their accounts. The threat of weak, reused, or easily guessed passwords is huge. Some of the most frequent issues caused by this are:
•Password fatigue: Difficulty in remembering multiple passwords.
•Security breaches: Using weak or old passwords can cause account breaches.
•Burdensome password management: Managing and renewing passwords on every account by hand is a hassle.
With no solid aid in password management, users rely on unsafe alternatives like poor-quality passwords or written-down passwords. 

Solution:
The Password Manager software resolves this issue by providing a simple, safe, and convenient means to save and store passwords. The solution capitalizes on:
•Python Standard Libraries: For encryption, file handling, and user interaction, using libraries such as hashlib, getpass, os, and sqlite3.
•SQLite Database: To securely store passwords in a local database, with encrypted data to avoid unauthorized access.
This password manager guarantees:
1.Secure storage: Passwords are stored in encrypted form inside an SQLite database.
2.Ease of use: Users can easily add, update, and retrieve passwords for different accounts.
3. Data integrity: Passwords are securely hashed prior to storage such that original passwords are never disclosed.
4. Local storage: No server in the internet is involved, such that data is stored locally and risks involved in online data breach are avoided.

Scope:
The scope of a password manager extends across both individual and organizational use, aiming to enhance digital security and simplify credential management. It supports secure storage of passwords, automatic form filling, password generation, and synchronization across multiple devices. In enterprise environments, password managers can also facilitate secure sharing of credentials among team members, enforce password policies, and monitor for data breaches. As cybersecurity threats continue to rise, the role of password managers is expanding beyond simple storage to becoming an integral component of a comprehensive security strategy.

Here are the objectives of a password manager in bullet points:
•	Secure Storage: Safely store users' passwords using strong encryption techniques.
•	Password Generation: Provide tools to generate strong, complex, and unique passwords for different accounts.
•	Breach Monitoring: Alert users if any of their stored credentials appear in known data breaches.
•	User Convenience: Eliminate the need to remember multiple passwords by centralizing access.
•	Policy Enforcement (for organizations): Enable administrators to enforce strong password policies and control access to shared credentials.

Methodology
A password manager creates, stores, and helps you use strong passwords, so you only need to remember one: your master password.
How It Works:
1.	Master Password: You create a strong master password. This unlocks everything.
2.	Password Storage: When you log in to a site, the password manager saves your username and password.
3.	Encryption: All passwords are scrambled (encrypted) for security.
4.	Autofill: It automatically fills in your login details when you visit a website.
5.	Strong Passwords: It can create strong, random passwords for you.
6.	Syncing: Your passwords sync across devices (phone, computer).
Tools Used:
•	Frontend (What You See):
o	HTML: Structures the website (buttons, boxes).
o	CSS: Styles the website (colors, layout).
o	JavaScript: Adds interactivity (password generation).

•	Backend (Behind the Scenes):
o	Python: Main programming language.
o	Flask: Framework for building the web application. It handles requests and connects the frontend to the backend.
Simplified Process:
The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) sends requests to the backend (Python, Flask). Flask encrypts and stores your passwords. When you need to log in, Flask retrieves and decrypts them. Everything is synced, so you have your passwords everywhere.
In short, it’s a secure vault for your passwords that makes logging in easy and safe, using a combination of frontend and backend technologies to ensure security and convenience.

Conclusion:
This Password Manager project helps people keep their passwords safe and easy to use. Instead of remembering many different passwords, you only need to remember one strong master password. The program saves all your other passwords securely by locking them with special codes (encryption). You can add, remove, and use your passwords easily whenever you want. Since it stores everything on your own device, your passwords are safer from online hacking. Overall, this project makes managing passwords simple and secure for everyone.
Limitations:
•	Passwords are only saved on your own device, so you can’t access them from other devices or back them up online.
•	There is no extra security step like a code sent to your phone (multi-factor authentication).
•	The app mainly works on a computer web browser and may not work well on phones or without internet.
•	It does not check if your passwords have been leaked or are weak.
•	The design is basic and could be easier to use or look nicer.

Future Work:
•	Add a way to save and sync passwords safely in the cloud so you can use them on any device.
•	Include extra security steps like multi-factor authentication to protect your account better.
•	Make apps for phones so you can use the password manager anywhere.
•	Add alerts if your passwords appear in data leaks so you can change them quickly.
•	Improve the design to make it easier and nicer to use.
•	Add features for sharing passwords safely with team members and setting rules for strong passwords.
•	Use even stronger methods to protect your passwords from hackers.
